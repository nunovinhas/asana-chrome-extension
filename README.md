#Asana Chrome Extension

Simple Google Chrome extension that allows to see your Asana's open tasks and quickly add new ones.


##Why?
==================================
One year ago I was working on a side project and the team was making use of Asana to manage that project. I needed a simple and faster way to create and mark tasks as completed.

So I made this <b>Quick & Dirty</b> extension to help me. 


##Based on
==================================
It is strongly based on the Asana Example available at <a>https://github.com/Asana/Chrome-Extension-Example</a>



##To build and run
==================================
1. <b>Get the code!</b> For that you can clone it with: <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/nunovinhas/asana-chrome-extension </pre></code>
2. Go to Google Chrome settings tab and select <b>Tools->Extensions</b>;
3. Be sure that the <b>Developer mode is on</b>;
4. Now you need to import the code from point 1. To do that <b>click on Load Unpacked Extension</b>.
5. Select the folder where you saved the code;

The icon of the Extensions appears on your browser. :)
